        "description": "The new WindTunnel® Air™ bagless upright uses a multi-cyclonic filtration system, which cleans the air moving through the filter to ensure no loss of suction. It features patented Hoover® WindTunnel® technology, which removes embedded dirt and minimizes blowback or scatter on carpet. While extremely lightweight at less than 12 pounds, this vacuum offers all the power needed to get floors truly clean, and is perfect for small spaces.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nThis vacuum is designed with a telescopic handle with built-in wand that detaches with one simple touch. Simply connect the stair hose to the built-in hose and easily clean stairs without having to lift and carry the vacuum. Other intuitive features include convenient power and brushroll controls, a carry handle on top of the dirt cup and a clear nozzle with no-scuff bumper. The body reclines all the way to the floor, so you can reach under furniture easily, and the brushroll automatically stops when you put the vacuum back in the upright position.<br/><br/>\r\n\r\nRequiring minimal maintenance, the Hoover WindTunnel Air bagless upright has a rinsable filter that can be easily cleaned under running water and a high-quality filter made with HEPA media – neither of which will need to be replaced during the warranty period with proper care.",
